darknrgy's 6WD Robot Project

This is a six wheel drive robot project. The robot is intended to be controlled over the internet viewed through a webcam.

There are three main components to the source code:

- Robot: Microcontroller code, written in AVR-GCC for the ATMega family of Atmel microcontrollers. Projects are developed through AVR Studio for Windows. 
- Robot Server: A python application that runs on the robot's main computer, a Fit-PC2. This application serves as a proxy for all internet communication as well as some robot babysitting. 
- Client: A wxPython application which provides the robot operator with an interface for interacting with the robot.
