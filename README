darknrgy's 6WD Robot Project

This is a six wheel drive robot project. The robot is intended to be controlled over the internet through a client written in wxpython and viewed through a webcam. The files tracked in git-hub are primarly source code for the AVR microcontroller used on the robot and various supporting applications.
